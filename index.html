                    <p class="lead"><br>This page is dedicated to our rat terriers: Luther, Logan, and Levi.<br>
                    My wife and I have been their proud owners for 9 years, and we would like to share some of the 
                    photos and stories of our time with each of the dogs.</p>

                    <h2>When Our Happy Home Began</h2>
                    <p class="lead">My wife and I met in the early 2000s and maintained a long-distance relationship for many years after becoming a couple. When we were discussing the possibility of her moving into my apartment, she informed me that if she was to move in with me, we would have to get a dog. Since I worked graveyard at the time, I understood why she would want company while I was away at night.</p>
                    <p class="lead">I didn't know what kind of dog my then girlfriend wanted, and I didn't know her level of experience she had with dogs. So, I decided to research a few different types of dogs and found the rat terrier a possible great fit to keep my wife company. While speaking to a breeder in Washington State, she gave me contact information to another breeder who lived about 25 minutes away. When I got off the phone, I immediately contacted the local breeder to see if she had any puppies for sale. She did have puppies and invited me to her house to look at them. My wife's birthday was coming up, so I decided to take the night off from work and take her to see the puppies.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Well, you should know what happened after visiting the puppies. Of course, my girlfriend fell in love with the little dogs and one of them actually picked her out. That dog is Luther. He would not let my wife look at any other dog. He pretty much decided she was his owner. About a month later, we took Luther for a walk by a lake which was located close to the house where we got him, so we decided to stop by and visit with the breeder (She was an elderly woman with whom we fell in love with after meeting her). While at the breeder's house, I noticed a puppy that was there when we got Luther. I had been fond of that dog and asked the breeder about the pup. Again, you know what happened. She gave me a deal and the dog that night. That dog is Logan. Side note: Logan was not the pup that I had been fond of but the other puppy that looked like him. That puppy wanted people to pet him but would run away every time you tried to get close to him. It took me about 10 minutes to catch him that night and has been the most loving dog ever since.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Three years later, my wife got puppy fever and we contacted the breeder's daughter since her mother had passed away. The daughter also breed rat terriers and had three litters on the way. We were lucky enough to spend time with Levi since he was a week old and brought him home at six weeks old. He was already eating on his own because his mama stopped feeding the litter. </p>
