After we brought Logan home, Luther was slightly jealous and tried to drown Logan in a friend's pond while we were planting a garden. Even at 9, Luther still has a puppy spirit and remains leader of the pack.</p>

With rubbing his head against your body and endless "kissing", there is no doubt this little guy truly loves us. He is also very protective of us and will bark to keep others away. Luther and Logan are litter mates (brothers) and are unseparable.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Levi is the troublemaker of the bunch. He wants to be king of the hill, but Luther will not give up the throne. Since he was born, Levi is food driven. He is shaped like a sausage because he knows my mom will feed him every time she has a meal. When he gets agitated, the hair on his back stands straight up, and when he gets excited, he spins in a circle. Levi has truly been a wonderful addition to our family.</p>
